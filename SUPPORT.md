## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/ganweisoft/WebPlugins/issues) before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new issue.

## Support Policy

WebPlugins releases may include new features, fixes (security and/or non-security), or a combination of both. Some critical issues may be fixed in a servicing update to the latest release.
